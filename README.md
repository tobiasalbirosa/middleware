# middleware
Middleware with nodejs and express, we can views and the users can't insert GETs via our URL 

 1- Go to middleware, to check if the url is true and if any data need to be added to our response or return value.
 2- Go to the router and redirect to a page if exists, else, draw an alert.
 3- If users try to send a false get from url directory, they has been turned to alert too.
